2025-05-16T16:43:58.085Z [INFO]: # Switching to commit: 3c38b4267f7e8e9b3dda359b1ab78daffb0c5677
2025-05-16T16:43:58.101Z [INFO]: Note: switching to '3c38b4267f7e8e9b3dda359b1ab78daffb0c5677'.
                                 You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
                                 changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
                                 state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
                                 If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
                                 do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
                                 git switch -c <new-branch-name>
                                 Or undo this operation with:
                                 git switch -
                                 Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false
                                 HEAD is now at 3c38b42 Updated deployment settings and public folder
