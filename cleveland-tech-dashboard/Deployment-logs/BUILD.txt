2025-05-16T18:04:48.004Z [INFO]: # Switching to commit: 0239785553008a2715f7ead59ac30c2e23a35b33
2025-05-16T18:04:48.019Z [INFO]: Note: switching to '0239785553008a2715f7ead59ac30c2e23a35b33'.
                                 You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
                                 changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
                                 state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.
                                 If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
                                 do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:
                                 git switch -c <new-branch-name>
                                 Or undo this operation with:
                                 git switch -
                                 Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false
                                 HEAD is now at 0239785 deployment path fixes
